        <h1>KHANYISA OLD AGE HOME</h1>
        <p>Our old age home, also called a senior living home, has been around for the longest time. In the past, old people who had no families to take care of them often lived in churches and shelters. However cities grew and families changed, governments and charities started to build old age homes for older people. Today old age homes do more than just give a place to live; they also provide medical care, fun activities and a community where seniors can make friends and stay happy.</p>
        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <P>Our mission is to provide a safe, warm and good environment for the old people, making sure that their physical, emotional and social well-being is taken care of while making a sense of community and purpose.</P>
        <h1>Our vision</h1>
        <P>Our vision is to create more respect amongst every senior citizen, valuing them and making sure we provide them with quality care and support, enhancing their quality of life.</P>
        <h1>Our team</h1>
        <P>At our old age home, we have a dedicated team of professionals who are willing to provide high-quality care and much-needed support to our elderly people. Our team works with love and care to make sure the elders feel safe and respected in their new home.</P>
